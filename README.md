# CREALINK - TRAVEL REVIEW SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITE

## Introduction

In the realm of digital tourism, the absence of comprehensive online platforms for travel reviews results in erroneous decision-making. Establishing a travel review platform is crucial, enabling individuals to share their travel experiences and insights. Without such a platform, travelers struggle to access reliable information, impacting their decision-making. Simultaneously, tourism businesses lack substantial online reviews to enhance service quality and customer experiences.
