## Introduction

In the domain of digital tourism, the absence of comprehensive online platforms for travel reviews often leads to erroneous decision-making. Establishing a robust travel review platform is imperative, facilitating individuals to share their travel experiences and insights. Without such a platform, travelers encounter difficulties accessing reliable information, impacting their decision-making. Concurrently, tourism businesses lack substantial online reviews to augment service quality and customer experiences.
